Luc research uses numerical simulations and data driven approaches to address reacting flows physics. 
The first and foremost studied problems relate to combustion and flames. Understanding the very details of the physics to answer scientific 
questions with computer simulation are the main objectives. 
Luc is developping physical modelling (set of equations) used in software specialized in virtual prototyping of environmentally friendly systems 
for energy production, transportation and transformation industries.
